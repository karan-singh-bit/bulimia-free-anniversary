      <h2>Dear Joanna,</h2>
      <p>
        Today marks one full year of freedom — a year of strength, healing, and growth.
        I am endlessly proud of you. Watching you fight, rise, and reclaim your life has been the most inspiring part of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't just a celebration of time — it's a celebration of <em>you</em>. Your courage, your heart, your soul.
        You are not your past. You are your power.
      </p>
      <p>Forever by your side, <br /> – Karan</p>
